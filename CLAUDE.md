# Bible Assistant — Architecture Map

Mobile-first app for voice-controlled Bible reading: speak (or type) a reference, hear it read aloud. React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind v3 + Zustand; a PHP backend (`public/api.php`) proxies OpenAI (chat / TTS / Whisper) and serves Bible text from local Zefania XML.

**Three build targets from one codebase**: the web PWA (`npm run build` → `dist/`, deployed to
https://bibleassistant.apps.schaefchens.de) and native iOS + Android via Capacitor 8
(`npm run build:native` → `dist-native/`, then `cap sync`). See "Native builds" below —
several things differ per target and getting them wrong is the usual source of breakage.

This file is the orientation map. When changing code, find the relevant subsystem here first, then read the named files.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server (the maintainer usually already has this on `localhost:5173`; probe before starting).
- `npm run build` — `tsc -b && vite build`. **This is the primary correctness gate** — keep it green.
- `npm run build:native` / `npm run sync` — the Capacitor build; `sync` also runs `cap sync`.
- `npm run icons` — regenerate every app icon from `resources/source/icon.png`
  (`scripts/icons/buildIcons.mjs`). It owns iOS, Android (legacy + adaptive, all
  densities, and the adaptive XML), and the web/PWA icons; splash screens are
  still `capacitor-assets`' job. Sizing is per role — full-bleed surfaces get a
  large glyph, only genuinely masked ones carry safe-zone padding — so don't
  "simplify" it back to one shared bitmap.
- `npm run bible:build` / `bible:verify` — regenerate the offline Bible packs, and diff them
  against golden fixtures from the PHP parser. **Run verify after touching either parser.**
- `./scripts/deploy.sh [--dry-run]` — deploy the PWA + PHP over SFTP. Uses an explicit
  allow-list: it must never upload `storage/` (live user data) or `secrets.php`.
- `npm run lint` — ESLint. Note: a handful of pre-existing `react-hooks/refs` errors live in `EyesFreeMode.tsx`, `FloatingPlaybackBar.tsx`, and `CardStack.tsx`; don't add new ones.

## Entry points
| Concern | File |
| --- | --- |
| Router + error boundary | `src/App.tsx` → routes render under `src/components/common/AppShell.tsx` |
| App init (audio teardown, last-reading, network, key hydration, ambient prefetch, pack retry) | `src/hooks/useAppInitialization.ts` — six independent effects |
| Voice/text command pipeline | `src/hooks/useCommandPipeline.ts` (`send()`), tool loop in `src/services/ai/orchestrate.ts` |
| Global mic / push-to-talk | `src/hooks/useGlobalVoice.ts` + `src/components/voice/*` |
| AI tool definitions (the model's API) | `src/services/ai/tools.ts` |

| Chapter narration download | `src/services/narration/downloadChapter.ts` + `src/store/narrationStore.ts` |
| Native speech recognition | `src/lib/nativeSpeech.ts` (Whisper stays the fallback) |
| Auto-continuation + prefetch | `src/lib/autoPlay.ts` |

## Data flow — a voice command
```
mic / text input
  └─ useGlobalVoice → useCommandPipeline.send(text)
       ├─ isStopCommand? → cancelAllActivity() (kills audio + aborts in-flight)
       └─ postChat({messages, tools})            [services/api/chat.ts → api.php ?action=chat]
            └─ orchestrateToolCalls() loops while the model calls tools:
                 dispatchTool(name, args)         [services/ai/dispatch.ts → TOOL_REGISTRY]
                   ├─ read_verses → getChapter/getVerses → buildPlaybackPlan
                   │     → startPlayback → audioPlayback.enqueue / browserTts.enqueue
                   │         → playbackStore.setStatus / setCurrent  (UI reads these)
                   ├─ create_card / create_board → libraryStore (+ Dexie + sync queue)
                   └─ set_* → settingsStore
            └─ assistant reply (if no read action) → speakAssistantReply → TTS
```
Reading aloud is the response: pure `read_verses` turns emit **no** chat text, only audio (logged as a `historyNote` so the model can later "continue reading").

### Reading hosts — how playback finds its verses

Every queued track carries a `groupId` (`PlaybackTrack.groupId`,
`usePlaybackStore.current.groupId`). It is an **opaque playback-group key**, not a chat
message id — it binds audio to the verses `WordHighlighter` highlights.
`src/lib/readingHosts.ts` resolves it by namespace prefix:

| id | host | a "reading" is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bare uuid (no `:`) | `chatReadingHost` | an assistant message with `verses` |
| `reader:<translation>:<book>:<chapter>` | `readerReadingHost` | a loaded chapter |

Anything in the playback path that needs "the verses behind what is playing" goes through
`readingHosts.getGroup(id)` — the transport, `autoPlay`, `playbackController`, the
last-reading writer, `startPlayback`, `playbackPosition`. **Never re-introduce a
`useChatStore.messages.find(...)` in that path**: that assumption is what used to make the
whole audio pipeline chat-only.

Resolution is per *id*, not per active screen, because both hosts can own live groups at
once (chat has readings from earlier in the session while the reader has chapters mounted).
`readingHosts.focus()` is consulted only for "what does Play start when nothing is queued?".

Auto-continuation is host-agnostic: `autoPlay` computes the next chunk from the group's own
verses and asks the host to `appendReading()` it. Chat materializes a new assistant message
(with a `historyNote` so the model knows); the reader inserts the chapter into its window.
A reader group is always a whole chapter, so it always takes `computeNextChunk`'s
whole-chapter branch — which is why the reader gets endless audio reading, TTS prefetch and
audio-driven endless scroll from the same mechanism, with no reader special-casing.

Reader group ids are **deterministic**, so scrolling away and back (or replaying) re-binds
the highlighter to already-queued tracks. `appendReading` must stay idempotent for the same
reason.

## Stores (Zustand) — who owns what
All in `src/store/`. `(persist)` = survives reload via `zustand/middleware`.
| Store | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `usePlaybackStore` | **Source of truth for audio state**: status, current track, word index (drives `WordHighlighter`), volumes |
| `useChatStore` | Conversation history, `isProcessing`, `currentTool` |
| `useSettingsStore` *(persist v14 + migrations)* | User prefs: locale, translation, voices, reading/announcement prefs, ambient, mic corner, `syncEnabled` |
| `useLibraryStore` | Cards + boards + their order + the offline sync queue (flushed to `api.php`) |
| `useRibbonsStore` *(persist)* | Colored bookmarks ("ribbons") |
| `useGlobalVoiceStore` | Mic listening state, last voice response |
| `useLastReadingStore` *(persist)* | Resume point for "play last reading" — **audio-owned**, written only from the playback subscription. The reader's scroll position deliberately does not write here, or idle scrolling would move it |
| `useReaderStore` *(persist v1 — `position` only)* | The reader screen: current chapter, the loaded-chapter cache + the mounted window |
| `useBiblePacksStore` *(persist — `wanted` only)* | Offline Bible packs: per-translation status/progress, and which translations the user has asked for |
| `useNarrationStore` | Per-chapter narration download state (status/progress/error). Transient — the truth is in Dexie and `check()` re-derives from it |
| `useUiLayoutStore` | Transient layout — `bottomBarHeight`, the height of whichever bar the current page puts above the nav (chat composer, reader pager), so floaters clear it |
| `useUpdateStore` (in `lib/pwaUpdate.ts`) | PWA update-available flag *(named `use*` though it's a store, not a hook — a known, intentionally-left naming exception)* |

`lib/` and `services/` read stores directly via `useXStore.getState()`; React components use
the `useXStore(selector)` hooks for reactivity. The one read path that *is* behind a contract
is playback-group → verses, via `src/lib/readingHosts.ts` (see above).

## Layer rules
- `components/` → call hooks + store selector hooks; presentational.
- `hooks/` → orchestrate; call `lib/` and `services/`.
- `lib/` → stateful singletons & logic (audio, gestures, sound cues); read stores via `getState()`.
- `services/` → stateless data access. `services/api/*` = HTTP; `services/bible/*` = reference parsing + verse fetch/format; `services/ai/*` = tool contract + dispatch.
- `store/` → Zustand state. `types/domain.ts` = canonical shared types. `utils/` = pure helpers.

## Naming conventions
- `use*` is reserved for **React hooks** (`hooks/`) and **Zustand store hooks** (`store/`).
- `lib/` singletons are camelCase nouns: `audioPlayback`, `browserTts`.
- `services/` modules export plain functions, not singletons.

## The reader screen (`/read`)

A fifth bottom-bar tab, right of Chat, for reading rather than asking. `src/routes/ReadPage.tsx`
plus `src/components/reader/*`; the store is `useReaderStore`.

- **Flowing prose, not one verse per line.** `WordHighlighter` takes `layout="inline"` so several
  verses share a `<p>`, with superscript verse numbers. The "currently reading" tint uses the
  `.verse-inline` CSS pair (background + `box-decoration-break: clone`) because the block
  variant's left inset bar and horizontal padding are meaningless on a wrapping span.
- **Paragraph breaks are computed** (`src/lib/readerParagraphs.ts`). None of the eight source
  bibles carries paragraph markup — `public/bibles/*.xml` has only `<verse>`/`<chapter>`/`<book>`
  — so the rule is "break after a verse that ends a sentence, once ≥4 verses have accumulated".
  Deterministic and never mid-sentence, but not editorial. `MIN_VERSES_PER_PARAGRAPH` is the knob.
- **Two fields, not one array**: `chapters` is a bounded cache keyed by group id, `visible` is the
  mounted window (`MAX_VISIBLE = 6`). The cache outlives window trimming so a track queued for a
  scrolled-away chapter still resolves. `MAX_VISIBLE` is the load-bearing render-cost mitigation
  (every verse mounts a `WordHighlighter` with two playback selectors, and the rAF loop rewrites
  `current` ~60×/s) — don't raise it without profiling.
- **Only `position` is persisted.** Verse text would bloat localStorage and go stale on a pack
  upgrade, and `getChapter` is memoized + in-flight-deduped so a re-fetch on boot is nearly free.
  First-ever open seeds from `useLastReadingStore`; after that the two are independent.
- **Paged vs endless** is `settings.readerEndlessScroll` (default off → prev/next chapter buttons).
  Endless appends forward from an IntersectionObserver sentinel and prepends backward from an
  explicit button. Both directions, plus window trimming, re-pin the scroll position in
  `useEndlessChapters` by **pinning a chapter element**, not by scrollHeight arithmetic — WebKit
  has no dependable `overflow-anchor` and iOS momentum scrolling fights raw `scrollTop` writes.
- **Versification gaps are normal, not exotic.** `BookEntry.chapters` is English versification, so
  the German texts legitimately lack chapters the catalog advertises (LUT's Malachi ends at 3
  where KJV has 4). A *step* absorbs that and keeps going the way the user was heading — forward
  rolls into the next book, backward walks down — while an explicit jump still errors. The miss
  arrives two ways depending on the source, so test it with `isChapterMissing()`
  (`ChapterUnavailableError` offline, `bible.chapter` 404 online), never `instanceof` alone.
- Switching translation stops reader audio before reloading: group ids embed the translation, and
  word counts differ between texts, so letting queued TTS play on would desync the highlight.
- **Known limitation:** a voice command on `/read` still produces a *chat* reading (audio plays,
  the page doesn't follow). Same as `/cards` today; routing it into the reader needs a target-host
  field on `SendOpts`/`DispatchContext`.

## Offline-first — what needs a network and what doesn't

The only genuinely online features are the **assistant** (chat needs the model) and
**generating** premium narration. Everything else — reading, the reader screen, cards,
boards, ribbons, playback of already-fetched audio — works with no connection.

**Sync is opt-in.** `settings.syncEnabled` is off on a fresh install; the v13→v14
migration backfills `true` for existing installs, which already have server data.
It is enforced at exactly three chokepoints, and they are the whole mechanism:

1. `syncQueueManager.enqueueOp()` / `enqueueOrderSync()` — drop ops instead of growing a
   queue behind a flush that will never run. Both report whether they queued, so
   `pendingOps` stays honest.
2. `libraryStore.flushQueue()` — the one path that pushes.
3. `libraryStore.pullFromServer()` — the one path that reads.

Guarding there rather than at the ~10 call sites is deliberate: a new caller cannot
bypass the opt-in by forgetting. Turning sync on costs one catch-up pass
(`enableSync()` → pull, then seed the queue from every row still `dirty === 1`, then
flush), which is what dropping ops buys.

**The mnemonic is a device key first, a recovery phrase second.** It is required
synchronously by every `api.php` call, so `hydrateIdentity()` mints one silently on
first run (see `lib/bootIdentity.ts`) and the user is only *shown* it when they turn
sync on. Never put it back in front of a first-run user: an app that reads scripture
offline must not open on "create an account".

**`isBundled()` vs `isPreinstalled()`** (`services/bible/packFormat.ts`) — the second is
the one to reach for when the question is "can I read this without the network?". It is
true only on native, where `cap sync` puts the packs in the asset bundle. On web the same
files are HTTP fetches the service worker doesn't precache (`globPatterns` excludes
`.json`; the packs are ~10 MB), so there the bundled texts are treated as ordinary
*downloadable* packs — which is the only reason the PWA can read offline at all. Only
`bible-packs/manifest.json` (71 KB) is precached, so the picker renders correct state
offline.

**Selecting a translation downloads it** (`biblePacksStore.want()`, wired into
`TranslationList`), and the active translation is wanted even if its row was never
tapped. Packs are ~1.5 MB gzipped, so this needs no confirmation.

**Narration resolves through a source chain**, `services/narration/narrationSources.ts`
— the audio counterpart of `chapterSources`, same "`null` means try the next source"
contract. `cachedNarrationSource` answers from a local index with **no** call to
api.php, which is the only way a chapter in IndexedDB is playable offline; before it
existed, `buildTrack` had to ask the server for a verse's URL first.

Two rules keep that honest:

- The URLs are recorded from api.php's response, never recomputed. Rebuilding its path
  scheme client-side would duplicate it in two languages and break silently the day it
  changes — which is what the `narration` Dexie table is for.
- Resolution requires an index entry **and** the bytes present (`isCached`). That's what
  lets ordinary playback populate the index for free without promising audio a cleared
  or evicted cache can't deliver.

**Downloading = pinning.** `mediaCache`'s `pinned` rows are exempt from LRU eviction, so
a chapter saved for a flight can't be reclaimed by whatever was played since. Enough
pinned data can push the cache past `BUDGET_BYTES` with nothing left to free; the sweep
stops, and Settings' storage readout is where that becomes visible. Downloads are
**per chapter** on purpose — a book means up to 2,461 verses of TTS plus forced
alignment — and cover exactly what the current settings would *play*, so a reader with
announcements off isn't billed for clips they'll never hear.

**A reading never plays silence.** `startPlayback.readingUsesBrowserVoice(plan)` folds
"definitely offline" into the engine choice — *unless* the whole plan is already
downloaded, in which case being offline is irrelevant and the premium narration plays.
All-or-nothing: a partial hit would read some verses in one voice and skip the rest.
`streamReading` additionally falls back to the device voice if the *first* track fails
for any non-abort reason (which also covers backend-down, no-key and quota).

Both are "decide once" by design: `playbackController`'s mid-reading rebuild and
`playFromVerseWord` keep asking `isBrowserVoice()` alone, because a reading queued while
online keeps working offline (its audio is in `mediaCache`, and seeking a queued track
needs no network), and because two engines sharing one queue talk over each other.

## Backend — `public/api.php`
Single PHP entry; routes on `?action=`. Per-user data dirs keyed by an identity derived from the user's passphrase. OpenAI actions (`chat`, `tts`, `tts.speak`, `transcribe`, `recording.upload`) require a key — a personal key (sent by the client) or the shared key, selected via the `X-Prefer-Shared-Key` header.

**Accounts are lazy.** `authenticate()` validates the identity headers and creates
nothing; `requireUserDir()` creates `storage/users/{id}` and is called from the router
only for `$ACCOUNT_ACTIONS` (the cards/boards writers, `auth.openaiKey.set`,
`recording.upload`). Everything else works with no directory at all — the readers guard
with `file_exists`/`is_readable` and answer empty. This is what makes the client's sync
opt-in truthful: a user who only reads scripture and asks the assistant questions leaves
nothing on the server. Don't move an action into `$ACCOUNT_ACTIONS` without meaning it,
and don't reintroduce an eager `mkdir` in `authenticate()`.

Actions: `chat`, `tts`, `tts.speak`, `bible.chapter`, `transcribe`, `auth.openaiKey.{status,set,clear}`, `cards.{list,upsert,delete,order.get,order.set}`, `boards.{list,upsert,delete,order.get,order.set}`, `recording.upload`, `account.delete`, `ambient.list`.

Bible text is parsed from Zefania XML in `public/bibles/*.xml` (S00, S51, LUT, HFA, ELB = German; ESV, KJV, NKJV = English). Client base URL + error handling: `src/services/api/client.ts` (`apiPostJson` / `apiGetJson` / `apiPostForm`, `ApiError`, `onUserKeyFailure`).

## Native builds (Capacitor 8) — the per-target differences

`vite build --mode capacitor` is a genuinely different artifact, not just a repackaged web build:

| | web | native |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base` | `/` | `./` |
| outDir | `dist/` | `dist-native/` |
| `publicDir` | `public/` | **off** — an allow-list is copied instead |
| Router | `BrowserRouter` | `HashRouter` (Android WebView ≥117 won't change paths on custom schemes) — `/read` is `#/read`, and `useLocation().pathname` still reads `/read` |
| Service worker | yes | none — no SW under `capacitor://` |
| API origin | same-origin, relative | absolute, from `.env.capacitor` (`src/services/api/origin.ts`) |
| Bible source | downloaded packs first, then network | bundled LUT/KJV packs first, then downloads, then network |

**`webDir` must stay `dist-native`.** `dist/` is ~300 MB and contains `secrets.php` (a live
OpenAI key), `storage/` (every user's cards + `secret.txt`) and the Bible XML, because Vite
copies `public/` verbatim. `vite.config.ts` has a recursive `closeBundle` assertion that fails
the build if any of that reaches the bundle — don't weaken it.

### Audio: why playback is an HTMLAudioElement, not Web Audio
Measured on iOS, not assumed: WebKit **suspends the AudioContext** as soon as the page is
hidden. Over a 13 s background window `ctx.currentTime` froze at 7.97 while a media element's
`currentTime` advanced 9.02 → 22.17. `UIBackgroundModes: audio` does not change this — Web Audio
never gets background privileges, and iOS only attaches lock-screen controls to media elements.

So: verses, assistant replies and ambient music run on media elements
(`elementTrackPlayer.ts`, `ambientAudioBus.ts`). The AudioContext remains **only** for UI cues
(`micCue`, `clickTick`, `thinkingDrone`, `speakLabel`), which are foreground-only so suspension
is harmless. Word highlighting reads `element.currentTime` directly.

Two traps live in `elementTrackPlayer.ts`, both learned the hard way:
- Priming with `play()` on a **src-less** element wedges it at `readyState 0` forever — prime
  with a real silent WAV, and always call `.load()` after assigning `src`.
- Never clear `src` from an async callback; it races `load()` and wipes the track out from
  under the element.

Interruptions (calls, Siri, headphone unplug) are handled by *following the element*: it fires
`pause`, and `onExternalPause` syncs app state. Web Audio gave no such signal. `AppDelegate`
reactivates the `AVAudioSession` when an interruption ends; playback deliberately does **not**
auto-resume.

### Speech input
Native builds prefer on-device recognition (`nativeSpeech.ts`, `@capgo/capacitor-speech-recognition`).
The Web Speech API does not exist in either WebView, so the web build is Whisper-only, and
Whisper (`?action=transcribe`) remains the fallback everywhere.

The iOS workaround layer — `iosAudioRouting.ts`'s silent-WAV nudge, the AEC/AGC-disabling
`micConstraints()`, `DUCK_FACTOR = 0` — is now **only on the Whisper/push-to-talk path**, which
still uses `getUserMedia` and so still hijacks the audio session. It can't be deleted while that
fallback exists.
